			      <p><br> Georgia isn't good at snow. Two inches fell in Atlanta and amidst car crashes and television parodies, snow skepticism was born. Georgians bravely took to YouTube, determined to demonstrate that neither matches nor lighters nor blowtorches (a disproportionate number of Georgians seem to own blowtorches) could melt that strange, white stuff that the government insisted was just frozen water. On film, the snow blackens, twists like plastic, and stubbornly refuses to melt.</br>
					  

<br> Although entire Web pages are dedicated to debunking the chemical snow theory, the simplest way to deal with snow skeptics is to put the stuff in a microwave or on the stove. Spoiler: It melts. The blackened snow was caused by soot from the lighter, because butane burns inefficiently, and as snow turns into slush under a blowtorch, it only appears not to melt. Bad Astronomy blogger Phil Plait explains how the snow is, in fact, slowly melting.</br>


<br> The entire episode, however, brings up a good question: Who was the first Georgian to decide to burn the snow, just to see what would happen?</br>

			      <p><br> Look around you. If you're in a room with 25 other people, odds are at least one of them believes the world is run by lizard people, according to a recent poll. Conspiracy junkies are well aware of the theory that cleverly disguised reptilian aliens traveled to Earth thousands of years ago to infiltrate our highest echelons of government. Proof exists in the form of terrifying YouTube videos revealing news anchors with reptilian eyes, and lack of any better explanation for Rob Ford.</br>

<br>You can dispatch the reptilian eye claim with relative ease, but only if you're willing to suffer through 3 minutes of this awful techno music. The quick version: If a video file is compressed, sped up, and zoomed in, a clever video editor can transform any human eye into a menacing reptilian slit. But if you insist on clinging to the lizard government theory, at least be prepared.</br>

<br>According to a few conspiracy theorists, it turns out the moon is just a convincing hologram, placed in the sky to mess with our heads. Naturally, there is proof in the form of a poorly made YouTube video that shows a power glitch in the moon's artificial electrical system. The Mad Revisionist took the time to parody moon deniers at great length, but it seems that several people didn't get the joke. For a more complete survey of conspiracy theorists who are clearly over the moon, Google "the moon is a hologram," and prepare to be abundantly disappointed.</br>

			      <p><br> As anyone who has ever seen a schedule ruined by a delayed flight can tell you, airports are hell. But conspiracy theorists believe that Denver International Airport is quite literally the den of the devil. Stalwart enemies of the New World Order maintain that a FEMA death camp is hidden beneath the airport, and that satanic symbols line the terminal walls. Just about every wild theory about Denver International is tidily wrapped up into a two-part documentary on the topic.</br>

<br>If only any part of the documentary was true. The Skeptic Project took great pains to take on this documentary point by point, and debunk every last detail. Conspiracy theorists claim that Denver's runways form a swastika; Google Maps suggests otherwise. They claim that the death camp was built to spray Hepatitis B on unnamed enemies, but the virus makes a rotten tool for genocide, killing just 5 to 10 percent of those infected. And the artwork, while creepy and open to interpretation, probably isn't meant to encourage devil worship.</br>

			      <p><br> Scientists were pretty much asking for it. A natural successor to Area 51, CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a secret underground laboratory that just begs conspiracy theorists to speculate wildly. And speculate they have.</br>

<br>Conspiracy theorists tried to sue CERN in 2008 for almost sucking the entire planet into a black hole, but another idea is far more creative. Turns out, the occult scientists at CERN are building a star gate to revive Osiris, ancient Egyptian god of the dead. And they have photographic proof: A statue of the Hindu god Shiva stands at the entrance to the LHC.</br>
<br>Put aside the fact that physics experiments can't bring back the dead. Fine. But what the heck does a statue of a multiarmed Hindu god have to do with reviving Osiris? One of the largest Hindu sects in India considers Shiva their supreme god, and odds are that a religious researcher at CERN decided to invite his lord into the lab. Admittedly, it made for a pretty interesting Bring Your God to Work Day.</br>
