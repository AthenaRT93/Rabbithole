    <p>Conspiracy Theory as defined by the Dictionary: a belief that some covert but influential organization is responsible for an unexplained event.</p>
	<p>Conspiracy Theory as defined by Wikipedia: is the fear of a nonexistent or alleged conspiracy or the unnecessary assumption of conspiracy when other explanations are more probable.</p>
      <p>Evidence showing it to be false, or the absence of proof of the conspiracy, is interpreted by believers as evidence of its truth, thus insulating it from refutation.

	<p>As a true believer, I believe that things can be explained. When too many Coincidences show up in a story you have to stop and think are you being sold a story or are these things just connected. Yes, connection can be found in anything but the one to look at is when you are being sold something. What the connections are shaky, when the math doesn’t add up, when they are pushing their narrative down your throat, QUESTION it! It’s the same feeling you get when someone is trying to pull one over on you.</p>
	<p>I am bringing this site to you so show you what other’s feel isn’t right as well as things that turned out to be true. We are not crazy, well not all of us, but we are suspicious.</p>
